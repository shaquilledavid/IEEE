2020 PyJaC coding competition.

PyJaC is a brand-new coding competition brought to you by UTMâ€™s Women in Science
and Computing Club (WiSC), UTM Mathematical and Computational Sciences Society
(MCSS), and UTM Physics Club (PC).

Our prompt: creat an IEEE encoder/decoder

An IEEE encoder/decoder should convert floating-point numbers to a decimal
representation and back to floating-point, depending on the operation chosen.
